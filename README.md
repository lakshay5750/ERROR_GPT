Simple GPT Chatbot
Project Overview
This is a proof-of-concept chatbot built as a simplified implementation of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture. The project demonstrates the fundamental components of a modern language model, capable of generating coherent text in a conversational manner. It was designed to be a learning tool to understand how a GPT works from the ground up, rather than using a large, pre-trained model.
Technologies Used
Language: Python

Deep Learning Framework: Tensorflow

Core Architecture: A simplified implementation of the GPT Transformer architecture.

Model Details
This chatbot is powered by a custom-built model that replicates the core components of the GPT architecture. It is a smaller model that relies on the fundamental building blocks of a Transformer, including:

Self-Attention Mechanism: The heart of the model, which allows it to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence to understand context.

Feed-Forward Network: A dense neural network layer that processes the output of the attention mechanism.

Positional Encodings: Small vectors added to the input embeddings to give the model a sense of word order, which is crucial for understanding sentence structure.

The model was trained on a small, custom dataset of [describe your dataset, e.g., "simple dialogue snippets," "stories from a specific genre," etc.].

Roadmap & Contributing
This project is a starting point and can be extended in many ways. Potential future improvements include:

Refining the architecture: Adding more layers or heads to the attention mechanism to improve performance.



Developing a user interface: Creating a simple web or desktop application to make the chatbot more accessible by using streamlit app and I deploy on it.
